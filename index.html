                <h2>AI Colorectal Polyp Detection</h2>
                <p>Trained colorectal polyp detecting AI. The yolov3 object detection model was trained on a set of colonoscopy images. It was able to achieve a precision of 0.81, recall of 0.99 and an f1 score of 0.89.</p><br><p> The dataset categorised polyps into different types and the difficulty that the model had with different types of polyps was then analysed. The difficulties of the object detector were then compared to the difficulties that human clinicians have.</p> <br> <p>Please note that, as the dataset is restricted and requires permission, I cannot include any of the polyp images from the dataset here or in the repository</p>

                <h2>Pygame Fishing Game</h2>
                <p>Created a visual fish collecting game, which included developing minigames to dodge seaweed and time reeling in. Players are able to navigate the map and fish in different ponds with different fish of various rarities. Players can then catch the encountered fish by beating the two minigames.</p>

                <h2>Particle Swarm Optimisation Analysis and Implementation</h2>
                <p>This was a university group project that I completed. We were tasked with designing a library, implementing particle swarm optimisation methods and investigating PSO variants. The PSO library is able to solve real valued problem with different numbers of dimensions (parameters to be optimised) by maximising a fitness function that characterises the problem.</p><br><p> My contribution was that I wrote the code in the PSO variants, run_experiments and the topologies files. This involved defining the particle and topology classes, as well as implementing stndard PSO and other weighted variants. I additionally designed and wrote the code to automate the experiments.</p>
